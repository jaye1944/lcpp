My first attempt was like this:

add_executable(hello main.cpp)
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage)
target_link_libraries(hello -fprofile-arcs)

As recommended, I've created a build dir and did the compilation from there:

$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./hello


The problem is that no coverage data was produced.

Then I've changed the CMakeLists.txt to this:

include(CTest)
add_executable(hello main.cpp)
add_test(hello_test ${EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH}/hello)
add_definitions(-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage)
target_link_libraries(hello -fprofile-arcs)

Then run this from the build dir:

$ cmake ..
$ make
$ make test
$ make ExperimentalCoverage
